In this program, I have experimented with pre-defined models of PyTorch, and by manually varying the layers of CNN in order to monitor the variation in training/testing accuracies along with the time taken for completion of training. Due the size of the trained mode, the file could not be uploaded. The best observed accuracy was when the model was trained on full-sized images using the GoogLeNet Architecture.
